# Availability
This notebook is an interactive way to see what data is available to MCNP. It is a modern version of the Listing of Available ACE Data Tables ([LA-UR-17-20709](https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-17-20709)). It parses the XSDIR on your machine and shows the data that is available to you.

If you are concerned about what this does you are free to examine the code yourself. It is available as an Open Source project on GitHub at <https://github.com/NuclearData/DataListing>.
