# ACEListing
This repository contains everything needed to list the available ACE data on any machine.

See [Availability](Availability.md) to see what ACE data is on your machine.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+

### Third-Party Python Libraries
We utilize a few third-party libraries. These are all widely used and probably already installed if you use a scientific Python distribution.
- [Jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)&mdash;[Project Jupyter's](https://jupyter.org) next-generation notebook interface.

   Even though jupyter-lab is "next-generation", it is completely stable (as of June 2019) and is the future interface for the Jupyter Project.

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

## Distribution
This package is distributed on GitHub at <https://github.com/NuclearData/DataListing>.
If you are concerned about what this does you are free to examine the code yourself.

We welcome Pull Requests for improvements and bug fixes.
