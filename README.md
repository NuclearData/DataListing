# Data Listing
This is a tool to list the data files available to MCNP on your machine. It uses the very nice [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) package to combine viewing and computing in the same tool.

To start, execute the command `jupyter lab README.md` in your terminal. If that doesn't work, please install JupyterLab.

If you have a question, please start a [discussion](https://github.com/NuclearData/DataListing/discussions/) with the developers on GitHub.

## Getting Started
First, make sure you have the [prerequisites](Requirements.ipynb); they are all commonly-available Python packages. After you have ensured that all the packages are installed, begin the tool by executing the following command in the same directory as this README file. 

```shell
jupyter lab README.md
```

It will open everything in the default browser on your machine. (If you see the source of the README file instead of a nicely-rendered version, right-click `README.md` in the window on the left and select *Open With* -> *Markdown Preview*)


See [Getting Started](GettingStarted.ipynb) to begin using this tool. After viewing that, see [Listing](Listing.md) to see what data is on your machine.
